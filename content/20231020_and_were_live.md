Well I finally got my website all set up. I decided to roll my own SSG instead
of using something like Jekyll (what any sensible person would do), so it took
a bit longer than it should have, but I'm decently happy with the result.

The plan is for this to be a place where I document and show off some personal
projects.

Anyway that's about it.  I'm only writing this as an inaugural first post.
Expect everything that comes later to be slightly more interesting.
